## Challenge project for the "C++ Essential Training" Formation Course.

This program is a message manager. There are two message types: **e-mail** and **mobile**. Each message has an associated 'sender' and 'receiver' (phone no. or e-mail address in each case) as well as message body and ID.

This program also allows producing formatted files with a message list. The user can add and retrieve messages from that list, as well as user information.
